# Stock Signal FastAPI App

## Current Working State (Checkpoint)
This checkpoint represents a stable version of the stock signal application with the following features working:

### Core Features
- FastAPI backend with optimized caching system
- Real-time stock analysis with technical indicators
- Efficient data caching with incremental updates
- Stock cards with instant data loading
- Segment-based stock filtering

### Key Components
1. **Cache System**
   - Location: `app/data/stock_cache/`
   - Format: JSON files per stock
   - Includes: OHLCV data, last update timestamp
   - Auto-refresh: Daily updates

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/stocks/price/{symbol}`: Fast price updates
   - `/api/stocks/analyze`: Full technical analysis
   - `/api/stocks/segments`: Stock categorization
   - `/api/stocks/search`: Stock search functionality

3. **Stock Analysis**
   - Moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA100)
   - Volume analysis
   - Swing point detection
   - Strong buy signals

## How to Use This Checkpoint

### To Save Current State
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Checkpoint: Working version with optimized caching and instant card loading"
git tag v1.0-stable
```

### To Restore This State Later
```bash
git checkout v1.0-stable
```

### Making Changes Safely
1. Create a new branch for changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

2. If changes break functionality:
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.0-stable
   ```

### Important Notes
